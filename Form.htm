<h2>About Me: </h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Sophie Watson, and I am a rising sophomore at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill majoring in Media and Journalism on the journalism track. I am planning to apply to the Hussman School of Journalism during the coming school year. I am also majoring in Sports Administration, as well as minoring in Music. My dream job would either be a sideline sports reporter or attend law school and become a sports agent. I am from Virginia, I love sports, traveling, and music, and I love spending time with family and friends</p>
